Description of Work Performed:The Office of Directives Management (DIR) manages a variety  of Department of State programs including; Centralized Business Forms Management, Foreign Affairs Manual and Associated Handbooks, Rule Writing, Information Collection, Delegation of Authority  and Federal Register for public notification.  To manage these programs, DIR uses an integrated tool, developed by Team Geneva, known as the Directives Business Matrix.  This tool helps DIR monitor, track, and schedule cross-functional activities to ensure changes are assimilated across programs. Geneva currently uses the eForms application, DIR Business Matrix and other supporting tools to provide the following services for Directive Management’s Forms Program: •	Manages over 850 DoS forms and 450 other agency forms by working with over 26 Bureau Offices to evaluate, develop, design, test, and stage forms for publishing to the Internet, Intranet and ClassNet sites. Provides forms in HTML, PDF and Word were applicable to meet the end user’s needs.•	Collaborates with Bureau Offices to introduce and implement eForms workflow processes for their program and business processes, reducing manual interaction by the users. Team Geneva has assisted DIR in deploying and maintaining over eighty (80) workflow forms throughout the Department of State and at posts.•	Under the direction of Directives, we continue to partner with other Bureau Offices to create smart/wizard forms. Team Geneva worked with the Department of Legal and Political Affairs, to convert the complex SF-278 Financial disclosure Form into a wizard form saving the user an estimated 35% of time to complete the form and received a written accolade from the Assistant Secretary for outstanding contribution to the SF-278 electronic processing program.•	Develops forms using a set of government standards for designing, formatting, testing and quality assurance to ensure consistency in engineering official DOS forms.•	Using the State Department’s Remedy application, Team Geneva provides Tier II support for eForms users world-wide.•	Geneva worked with DoS IRM to provide NT Domain, biometric, and PKI signature support for new forms.  We also ensured compliance with the Section 508 mandates by incorporating unique instructions, testing with Jaws software, conducting tedious tagging of forms, testing with the IRM Program  for Accessible Computer /Communication Technology (IMPACT) office,  and staging forms for publishing.Geneva supports Directives with codification and management of 16 volumes of Foreign Affair Manual (FAM) material, and 32 Foreign Affairs Handbooks (FAH), which contain over 25,000 pages of policies and procedures.  We manage the Information Collections (IC) Program by coordinating with 32 program offices to ensure forms are validated, compliant with the Paperwork reduction Act (PRA) and are ready for submission to the Federal Register.Geneva provides in-depth reviews and analyses (including document structure, amendatory language, and Federal Register publication requirements) for all Department rules. As part of an interagency team, we supported the Federal Docket Management System (FDMS), provided training, and acted as the database administrator for DoS.  Management ApproachIn collaboration with the State Department’s Program Managers, our Program Manager works across 32 bureau offices to manage the various programs under Directives. Our Program Manager uses PMBOK management methodologies coupled with the practices outlined in Managing State Projects, while incorporating the unique attributes of each program in order to meet customer requirements.Technical ApproachJ.1.1- Initiation, Concept, and Planning Services.Geneva utilizes industry standard Software Development Lifecycle management techniques, as well as industry standard form design principles. J.1.2- Requirements Services. Each Directive program has unique business requirements, therefore Geneva Software was tasked by the client to develop an internal tracking and management tool called the Directives Business Matrix. The Business Matrix allows program data to be used interactively in support of each program. Data are synchronized on a daily basis. This cross-functional data-sharing approach provides a foundation across all of DIR’s business lines and results in improved functioning of each business line. It ensures that data and information in DIR policy development, forms, information collections, rules and the federal register functions work together to meet the standards outlined in the Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM2), and Foreign Affairs Handbook (FAH-2 H-100).  Our Program Manager uses the Business Matrix to track the progress and status of each program and the tasks associated with the program. J.1.3- Design Services.	Geneva Software provides forms design support for 1,300 forms. Geneva is responsible for designing the SharePoint portal to ensure users can easily access information provided by Directives.  The SharePoint site is the single point where over 65,000 users at the State Department come to obtain business forms, FAM, FAH, and Regulatory information.  We also collaborate with other Bureau Offices at State to ensure information is posted and displayed in a manner that provides ease of access. We design and deploy information on the State Department OpenNet, and ClassNet.  Our designs take into consideration sharing of information, Section 508, and the protection of PII data.  Geneva designs workflow forms that eliminate redundant processing, promote sharing of information, and help the Bureau office obtain checks and balances through electronic processing and validations. Geneva use eForms Wizard technology to design and publish forms and generate several widely used formats, including PDF, eForms, and HTML.J.1.4- Development Services.Geneva Software uses industry best practices, coupled with adherence to the SDLC guidance, Managing State Projects, of the Department of State for requirements management, design, development of software components, as well as maintenance of legacy software and functionality. Geneva Software supports the eForms and Business Matrix applications by developing detailed requirements, designing, testing, implementing and conducting ongoing maintenance to ensure the application development life cycles are completed successfully. Geneva Software worked with the Visual eForms vendor to replace the legacy application “Form Flow” with Visual eForms. We supported deployment of eForms using ASP, .NET and J2EE technologies. Geneva Software coordinates with Patch Management, Regional System Administrators, ESOC, Diplomatic Security (DS), and A/EX/IRM to deploy eForms Object Control X (OCX) component. The OCX deployed to over 65,000 desktops world-wide.J.1.5- Test Services.Geneva provides testing throughout the forms design lifecycle.  This includes testing for standard forms design and workflow development efforts.  Our testing including quality assurance, formatting, spelling, grammar, workflow validation, testing, PII, and user acceptance testing.  Information Collections are time-sensitive and require approval by legal and the Office of Management and Budget prior to deployment.   Geneva Software has implemented tight procedures, standards, and automation to ensure Information Collections are completed on time.  Over the past year, we successfully processed over 100 collections and received zero violations, a major improvement over prior years. Additionally, in support of the forms program, we compile annual reports for OMB outlining the performance of the Information Collection program as it relates to meeting PRA requirements.Geneva Software works with the State Department’s Bureau Office to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. J.1.8- Maintenance Services.Geneva supports ongoing maintenance of all program of the Office of Directives Management including:  maintaining the SharePoint portal, design and maintenance of workflows and forms, ensuring policies and procedures in the FAM and FAH are up-to-date. Geneva Software developed a comprehensive workflow tool (Business Matrix) used to track inputs and outputs of work received and processed through Directives for all business lines. The Business Matrix is developed using Microsoft Access - VBA and VB.Net for external projects. The Business Matrix report module is used to extract management reports. These reports are used for conducting performance measurement analysis, identifying deficiencies in processes and developing comprehensive refinement plans. Geneva Software developed management reports providing Directives with the ability to retrieve reports, conduct performance measurements analysis, identify deficiencies and develop and implement refinements.	J.1.9- Support Services.Geneva Software assists Directives with training with the functional operations of eVisual, RevCom, Directives Business Matrix and Telework applications, managing the help desk for general inquiries, development of user documentation to assist with PKI and 508 initiatives, technical support for web application related questions, and assisting/ensuring an internal program for Quality, Planning, Measurement, and Refinement, and provide technical expertise in implementing ISO 9000 requirements towards Certification.,V
With customized requirements in-hand, public health agencies are better equipped to make informed “buy or build” decisions about their information systems and ensure the system’s interoperability with other health departments and agencies.  Additionally, the customized requirements helps to ensure conformance with national standards.,v
